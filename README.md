## 🎯 How It Works

Each project is self-contained and runs independently. You can open any folder and launch the project directly in your browser or local development server.

1. **Choose a Project**  
   - Navigate to any folder inside the repository (e.g., `project-1`, `react-dashboard`, etc.)

2. **Run the Project**  
   - For HTML/CSS/JS projects, open `index.html` directly or host locally  
   - For React-based projects, install dependencies and start the dev server

3. **Explore the UI**  
   - Interact with the application and explore its features and responsiveness

## 🚀 Usage

### Run Locally (No Installation Required)

#### Option 1: Open Directly
```bash
# Just double-click the index.html file
```

#### Option 2: Use a Local Server (Recommended)

**Using Python:**
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

**Using Node.js:**
```bash
npx serve
# Then open the provided local address in your browser
```

#### Option 3: For React Projects
```bash
npm install
npm start
# Runs the app in development mode
```
